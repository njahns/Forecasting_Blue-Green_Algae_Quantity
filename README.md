# Forecasting_Blue-Green_Algae_Quantity
Phycocyanin is a pigment-protein complex found in cyanobacteria. Monitoring concentrations in lakes can provide valuable information about water quality, particularly regarding the extent of cyanobacterial blooms, which can produce cyanotoxins. This project involves developing a model to forecast phycocyanin concentrations using data from an in situ water quality monitoring unit in a semi-urban reservoir. Five metrics were collected for over three years at half hour increments for a total of 50,000 rows. Data was cleaned, explored, and preprocessed and multiple forecasting models were developed.
